# C - More malloc, free

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on dynamic memory allocation in C, specifically using `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. The project includes several functions that demonstrate advanced use of these memory management tools.

## Files

* `0-malloc_checked.c`: A function that allocates memory using malloc.
* `1-string_nconcat.c`: A function that concatenates two strings.
* `2-calloc.c`: A function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.
* `3-array_range.c`: A function that creates an array of integers.
* `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.

## Requirements

* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* Code should use the Betty style
* No global variables allowed
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Only allowed C standard library functions are malloc, free and exit
* You are allowed to use _putchar
