# C - malloc, free

This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`. It includes several functions that demonstrate the use of these memory management tools.

## Files

* `0-create_array.c`: Creates an array of chars and initializes it with a specific char.
* `1-strdup.c`: Returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
* `2-str_concat.c`: Concatenates two strings.
* `3-alloc_grid.c`: Returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
* `4-free_grid.c`: Frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by alloc_grid function.
* `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.

## Compilation

All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
