# Singly Linked Lists

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum. It focuses on implementing and working with singly linked lists in C.

## Description

This project contains C functions that perform various operations on singly linked lists. The functions are implemented according to specific requirements and follow the Betty style guide.

## Files

* `lists.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and the structure definition for the linked list.
* `0-print_list.c`: Function that prints all elements of a list_t list.
* `1-list_len.c`: Function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
* 

## Requirements

* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* Code should use the Betty style
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Only allowed C standard library functions are malloc, free, and exit
* Function prototypes should be included in lists.h
* All header files should be include guarded
